      " Tiger Analytics is a company that helps organizations turn raw data into useful insights and smart decisions. Here it is in simple terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What they do  \n",
      "   • Collect and clean data (from sales records, customer feedback, sensors, etc.)  \n",
      "   • Use statistics and machine-learning models (“smart computer programs”) to spot patterns  \n",
      "   • Build easy-to-use dashboards and reports so teams can see what’s happening in real time  \n",
      "   • Automate routine tasks (for example, predicting when a machine might fail or which customers might leave)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Why it matters  \n",
      "   • Helps companies save money (by spotting inefficiencies)  \n",
      "   • Increases revenue (by identifying best customers or products)  \n",
      "   • Improves customer experience (by offering personalized services)  \n",
      "   • Speeds up decision-making (by giving managers clear, data-driven recommendations)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Who they work with  \n",
      "   • Banks and financial firms (fraud detection, risk management)  \n",
      "   • Retailers and CPG companies (demand forecasting, inventory optimization)  \n",
      "   • Manufacturing and healthcare (quality control, patient outcome predictions)  \n",
      "   • Technology and telecom (network optimization, customer churn analytics)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. How they do it  \n",
      "   • A mix of data engineers, data scientists, and business consultants work together  \n",
      "   • They build custom solutions—no “one-size-fits-all” tools  \n",
      "   • Use cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and open-source software (Python, R)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Extra support  \n",
      "   • Tiger Analytics Academy: training programs for companies and individuals who want to learn data science skills  \n",
      "\n",
      "In a nutshell, Tiger Analytics is like a team of data detectives and engineers who help businesses ask smart questions of their data—and then give them the tools and models to answer those questions reliably.\n"
